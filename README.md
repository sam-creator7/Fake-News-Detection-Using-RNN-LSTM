# Fake-News-Detection-Using-RNN-LSTM

Fake news dissemination is a social marvel that is unavoidable on a personal level, as well as through web-based media such as Facebook and Twitter. We're interested in counterfeit news because it's one of many types of double dealing in online media, but it's a more serious one because it's created with the intent to deceive people. Since we've seen what's going on, we're concerned about this. We are concerned about this issue because we have witnessed how this marvel has recently created a shift in the direction of society and people groups, as well as their perspectives, through social correspondence method. Along these lines, we chose to confront and decrease this wonder, which is as yet the principal factor to pick a large portion of our choices. Our goal in this research is to create a detector that can predict whether a piece of news is fake based just on its content, then approach the problem from a simple deep learning perspective using RNN technique models LSTMs and Bi-LSTMs.
